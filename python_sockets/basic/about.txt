INET - ip4 sockets 
 what is a socket?
	- a end point of a communication channel
	- used in IPC, websockets
	- 2  types of sockets exist SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM
	- many address family are available for use
      eg       AF_INET , AF_INET6 , AF_UNIX(for IPC in unix system locally),AF_PACKET,AF
CLIENT side
#	AF_INET = INET streaming sockets
	s = socket.socke(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	s.connect(('python.org',80))
#socket s establishes connection sends req
#the same socket s reads the reply from the server after reading the sockets
# gets destroyed


SERVER side
	serversocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	serversocket.bind((socket.gethostname(),80))  #gethostname() so that the
# socket is visible to outside world and for local visiblity bind(('localhost',80)) == 127.0.0.1
	serversocket.listen(5)   # queing upto 5 requests before refusing requests
# client
    clientsock , addr = serversocker.accept()



NOTE
	- both of the sockets on each end here are similar server = client i.e they they have same powers
	- the use of client-server model is not compulsary in the use of sockets it is the choice of the developer
