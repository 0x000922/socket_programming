INET - ip4 sockets 
 what is a sockets? 
	- used almost everywhere in IPC(inter process communication)
	- a general idea of client-server architecture 
CLIENT side 
#	AF_INET = INET streaming sockets 
	s = socket.socke(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	s.connect(('python.org',80))
#socket s establishes connection sends req 
#the same socket s reads the reply from the server after reading the sockets 
# gets destroyed 


SERVER side
	serversocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	serversocket.bind((socket.gethostname(),80))  #gethostname() so that the 
# socket is visible to outside world and for local visiblity bind(('localhost',80)) == 127.0.0.1
	serversocket.listen(5)   # queing upto 5 requests before refusing requests 
# client 
    clientsock , addr = serversocker.accept()
